Yes, this so like previously Satish as you were like in the meeting summarization page, we are giving an option to redirect to the Q&A right? So now what we did now in the meeting summarization page itself, we have given an option like if user wants to ask a question, so the screen will be split and then he can ask a question he or she can ask a question and then he'll get output over there itself. OK, so which means like you are not again forcing user to upload the document right? Because initially first summarization we will upload then again for Q&A the reupload or second upload it will be happen. But now a single upload multi functionality it will support. Exactly. So if you want I can show you like a quick demo kind of thing. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So yeah. So the front page will be same. So now if I upload. So you can just notice the time reduction also Satish. Yeah. Previously it is taking three to four minutes. Now it is being reduced to like approximately 60 seconds. OK, so this means without reducing the content in VTT file right? Yes. Now we will target like the what we can say the ranking of the text based upon the ranking of the text will summarize the data so it will also reduce some of the time. OK. Yeah. Just a second. Yeah, so you can see it took 64 seconds. OK. We generate the response. Response is there. So the thing is like if you see here we add a Q&A kind of thing. So now it will split the screen and user can ask a question like. What is workflow for? User will get the answer for this and the answer will be shown up here. OK. And one more thing also we can do. Let's see this first and we can just because in a single page all three functionality we can also provide. Now we are providing two functionalities here right. So in this itself you can add one more drop down in between that ask your question here right. And that in text box you can add like parallel you can run the question generation also. OK. So whenever the user feels like is is clueless about what what question you need to ask right. You can select the drop down and the question you can select the question and if they click the button means already the Q&A both the answer and question we will be generating right. We can directly map that answer and we can show. Else if you want to edit that question also we can give the edit option you can edit the question and this Q&A also it can be run. OK. So basically a drop down kind of thing over here. So where we can give two options like ask a question or generate a question. So generate question parallel it should run. OK. So you can see like first ask a question will come first. The drop down will be disabled for a few seconds. User cannot able to click it. But once you are parallel things run right once the file uploaded you need to run all the I mean the summarization also it will run and also question generated also it should be running a separate thread. In that thread it will run for the Q&A. So you show this page but until unless that question and answer generation completes right you just disable the drop down. Once that was done you can you can enable that drop down thing. And then if I.\n",

Yes, this so like previously Satish as you were like in the meeting summarization page, we are giving an option to redirect to the Q&A right? So now what we did now in the meeting summarization page itself, we have given an option like if user wants to ask a question, so the screen will be split and then he can ask a question he or she can ask a question and then he'll get output over there itself.

Yeah, if we want to download, we can just provide download option over there also. Yeah, this is the one update and the second one is like as per the Anand's point now like we have to extract the like let's suppose if someone was sharing any URLs or links in the meeting, then we have to extract the URL first and then whatever the content which is there in the URL we need to summarize that, right? So that part also we have completed so. As of now, the major problem is like we need to train our model properly. Then only we will be extract the extract URLs and the name properly, right? So that's how you are planning using any object detection model from the image. You are going to extract the URL or. No, basically like previously what we are doing like we are extracting the text from the image and based upon regex like we we are giving the regex pattern over there. So regex pattern over there and then we are extracting. Yeah, OK, so how you identify the end point for because HTTP will be a format and it will be. Yeah, so and yeah. So like once we extract the URLs now what we will do, we will check whether the URL giving the status code or not like status goes 200 or not so it will identify like whether the URL is correct or not. Something like that. So now you can see this like there are three members Akshash Ravastava, Akash Vandana, Alok and this is the link which we shared during the meeting paperswithcode.com. So the output will be link one papers.code. This is just the link provides access to wide range of research papers and code related to the meeting summarization. So like this is the summary of the content which is there in this link. Got it, so we can come later, but this is good. Is there any possibility to identify or breaking between link one and link two? It's it's in a single paragraph instead of that. Two different rows we can able to show. Yeah, we we are like so let's suppose in a in a meeting we are sharing two links so we will like first we will identify the this is the first link and then will append in a list. Then for the second link we will again append this in a second. So that's fine. Just in a UI thing I'm just telling like instead of this thing right you can split it into two cells maybe or line by link one link two it's it's it's incorporated in the link one itself right? Got it got it got it. Yeah, sure, yeah. We just made these changes before 15-20 minutes before Satish. So we will just work on the modification part. So once this was done, you just share me this code. I will deploy this one and will provide you one. Sure. Yeah, so there's one more thing like for this updation and all the changes for UI. Piyanka help us so just wanted to. Yeah, that's OK. OK. Thank you. Thanks team. Yeah, the initial. Any update? It's a disaster in the CN model. It's getting over fit so I'm training LSTM inside and currently training now. I'm training them all. OK so. As of now, what are the models which we are concentrated on this CNN LSTM RNN DVM because CNN obviously it won't work for better for text one. Yeah, actually this is the second model. It's like LSTM takes time, right? For training and also like I got more PDF from so today I entered so. Sorry, can you please come again? You get PDF now. I got more PDFs, DRI and ASP PDFs from K serve today. OK, so I will extract text from that and add into those in the existing. OK, existing model you're doing right?

So, pre-trained models, we can say, but we have, we have limitations with tokens, right? So that's why we are going this way. If this is, if this does not work, we can move to training. Yeah, yeah. So because transformer models, we have two options. One thing, it should work generally for the things, right? Because you need to do state, statement by statement or sentence by sentence embedding you need to do and just train the document on that one. Okay. That classification will be happening on that one. Okay. It will cut off that tokens as well, even though the sentence is greater there. Else, what we can do is we need to put a logic to prepare a data set itself. So if the max token is 556 or 535, right? So we need to see like how much tokens it was allowed. And then we need to divide some kind of chunks, again, the same thing. Okay. So, and then we need to see because if it is a meaningless sentence means we need to break in between itself.

            "Transcript :  that is specifically built for ticketing related use cases right? Like service now we are a partner to service now and service now is one such product that has predominantly been used across the industries. For ticketing, ticket management, all kind of ticketing solutions. The other approach could be, but when we're talking about service now like products, what's going to happen is it has to scale up to your entire enterprise number one and it should also be scaling up to your customers enterprise as well, right? Like it's not just for. You, but also for your customers as well, right? So that is another aspect that we have to look at. The second approach could be that you know we can look at your specific needs because the volume of tickets that you're talking about is less. We could probably build a simple solution to start with that allows you to start managing the current volume of tickets right which could also be and slowly build it on top of economies of scale right like basically saying we can create a custom built product for you to handle your tickets and then start looking at what are the features that you want to add because when it is custom built it allows you to. Probably build more features as well rather than going and buying a product from the market, right? So that is another thought process that we had, but in in on the same wean I just had one question. Misha Mohammed. So when you are when you are designing will this ticketing platform be directly used by your customers or will your team be using this on behalf of your customers? OK, first regarding your question, my ticketing will support two issues for my for my factory. First issue is customer raising the problem which highlighting in the final product and second issue is the final product and at the same time it should be used by quality department regarding raising any defective or some issue he facing during checking the product before delivering to the end client. So it will be with my by my team and my end client. It will be support both issue. And second issue which I asking you now, you told me we having custom solution or we having a product approach or ready made solution. This based on how many tickets expected per week or per day. Regarding custom solution. In case on future OK this ticket increase. This custom solution could handle it or not. I don't know what is the future for me. Now we having talking about ticketing inside factory and outside factory and we talking about approximately maybe 10 product OK. So this 10 product in future maybe maybe we reaching to 200 ticketing per week as example 300. I don't know what is the future. So how much your customer solution will support me in the future? This first issue. Second issue, how much it is easy for use? OK, we don't need any complicated system. OK, we need to support a small application which could be using by all our employee or client to raise a ticket by easy way. OK. So could you answer me to this issue? Sure, thanks for bringing both these points. So when I when I mentioned a custom solution. What I what I did what I was actually alluding to was. Depending on your current needs and your future needs like today, you're saying there might be 20 tickets per day or 20 tickets maximum. Tomorrow it should scale to 200 tickets also, right? So any solution that we are trying to build, whether custom or from the market. That solution has to be scalable, reliable and it should also be appealing to the economies of scale. It should also be economical, right? So from a custom solution standpoint, custom solution I was talking more about building a web application for you right or building an application for you hosting it in your premises in your server and exposing that web application as a URL to your customers so that they can log into this particular product or solution and then be able to do whatever they want to do. Right? So ideally any solution that we build has to be strategically built in such a way that it can manage higher volume of tickets Mr Mohammed. So as part of the exercise, if we are taking the route of a custom solution and it's too early to do that now.\n",

            "Transcript :  the chief solutions officer for with Kennedy Software and I was expecting him to join here. So Anand, just to give you a background right, Mohamad is from KFP Group Holdings who are basically into electrical relay manufacturing and as we discussed you know he was pointing out to a ticketing system, the requirement right, the ticketing system, the document management system and on the workflow, the complete workflow management system for their organization right. So we, he started off discussing, we started off discussing on the ticketing system and just to give you a heads up you know this is for the clients, for their clients, you know when there is some issue or when there are some queries regarding their, the product right, they raise a ticket, it goes to their back-end team and they resolve it and you know they, he also wanted to track the previous tickets as well right, just to give a customer satisfaction right. So this is what has happened at the back-end and we were also checking with this, checking with them on how many tickets he is expecting per month or per week and he indicated 10 to 20 number tickets is what he has indicated. So that's the conversation and you can, I guess you can take it over from here Anand. Sure Srini, Mr. Mohamad sorry about joining a little late, I had some issues with my laptop. So from a ticketing standpoint right, Arun did we already touch base on ServiceNow as a ticketing platform? I didn't jump on ServiceNow but I was asking questions about the volume of tickets, what is the purpose of a ticket, how many people will be agents, I mean we are looking at to handle, I mean I didn't jump into solution but just waiting to understand more about that but feel free to go ahead. Sure, I mean I had just some follow-up questions right, so if it is 20 tickets per user per day or is it 20 tickets across all your users Mr. Mohamad? No, no 20 tickets per week, not per day, I'm not expecting too much ticket here because as I mentioned earlier it is dependent on your quality of product okay, we are not a service company, we are a manufacturer company. So based on quality of product you get the ticket but most of time it is not be more than 20 tickets per week. Regarding the organization, who will be using this ticket number okay, we could now estimate it about 10 up to 15 person in meantime but in future maybe increase because it's based on your business grow up and many factor effect is issue but let us start by 15 pairs. Okay, got it and I just want to mention here actually the company is mostly in the B2B business, it's not a B2C, so their customers are almost mostly will be like other manufacturers, other like you know it's all the electricity like big groups it's a B2B, so just consider this one when you come when you're I mean designing the solutions, it's how they don't be the end user. No, no I couldn't hear you. Yeah, no Mr. Mohamad, I'm saying I mean mostly of the customers. The second request which Mohamad want to talk about was on the document management Anand, we didn't start, we just then is workflow, the fourth one is cyber security but the priority he says to start with you know he's looking for ticketing solution, so when I'm understanding all the problems in the document management system that is the higher priority, first is ticketing management system, then document management system. Siraj, you were also mentioning about the workflow right to automate their workflow internal. Yes, yes the workflow is the one I mean therefore as a DMS document management system, it has to be integrated with the workflow. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for this. It's all right. No problem. Okay, your question again. No Mr. Mohamad, I was just trying to say to Mr. Anand that your customers are mostly like a business to the business customers right, we are not I mean so it will be like enterprise customer, so it won't be like end users correct, just to correct me if I'm wrong. No, no I couldn't get you ready. No, no what he means by that, so for example he's talking about your primary customers will be other companies, for example National Grid or other companies. It's not the end users, it's a company. Correct, that's what he's saying. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead Anand. Okay, and one another question that, so there are two or three different approaches for this Mr. Mohamad. One is we can, we can use a market friendly tool or a product.\n",

            "Transcript :  So myself and Siraj, we had, you know, few understanding on what is the ticketing system, you know, for what you are looking at the ticketing system. I understood from Siraj that you are, you want your customers, you know, I understand that your company is into electrical relay manufacturing and you supply electrical relays to other companies, right? And if the end customer has some query or has some problem with the electrical relays which you have supplied, that they need to log on to a system, raise a ticket so that it comes to your back end, you know, people and they find the system, they get this alert on the, you know, they get the alert, they look into what is the issue and they contact the, either they contact the customer or they solve their queries or issues, is my understanding right? Yes, but I need full tracking system for ticketing. What meaning? Customer raise a ticket, okay, and tracing who responsible to handling this ticket, even after that tracing steps of the solution, not only I raise ticket today, after four days or five days, it solve it and the clause by ticketing number like this, by reply like this. No. I need all steps that will be used for a sole solution and was mentioned all authorization and all people concerned at this issue, okay, with full record of the document for this solution. Because in future, when we dealing with national grid electricity company, as example, we have one project and submit our equipment, they raise some comment, okay, this comment coming to us and we reply by some document, maybe clause, after maybe four or five years, same comment maybe raise at another project, okay? Understood. At this case, I should having a very good tracking system to retrieve this document, which I replied before, with the full reply, with the full situation and concerning people from me and from client who approve about this reply and give a clearance to, as an evidence for a next project or future project. You got my point? Okay. Understood. Yeah. So that is pretty much the ticketing system is used for, right? It is not only for tracking the current issues, but also to revisit on the cases, which was there before, let's say one year or six months before, what is the issue, right? So that is how we give our, you give the customer experience or customer satisfaction to your vendors or to your clients. We totally get that. I'm just waiting for one other gentleman to join. So till the time he joins, right, let me understand more about the Dock 1 management system as well. Right. And, okay. Sorry. One minute. Sorry to interrupt you. So before you go to the Dock 1 management, Mr. Mohamed, could you please let me know the volume of tickets and the queries you're expecting on average? Your voice is not clear, please. Is it better now? Better now? No, not better. If you could write your question as a shirt, write it and I reply, no problem. No. Okay. His question was, Mohamed, so he was checking with you. What is the volume of, you know, tickets, you know, how many tickets per month or how many tickets per week will, you know, are you talking about, you know, currently? I get the point. Sorry, to be honest with you, now we are a factory for two or three products, okay. But we expected at the end of this year, we're having another four products, okay, and a huge product with a huge system. But we couldn't predict how many will be expected, a ticketing number per month, because we are a manufacturer and this is based on quality of your product and how much your client is aggressive and like this, many, many issues will control this issue. But for this time being, it is not more than, what we say, 20 tickets per week, per week, okay. Like this. Okay. Mohamed, maybe increase in the future. Yeah. Yeah. I have Anand, you know, who...\n",

            "Transcript :  but if we are taking the route, we will be providing all the necessary thought process and thought leadership around what are the technology stack that will allow you to scale in terms of volume. Secondly, the ease of use. So the ease of use predominantly happens depending on how the users are able to very quickly navigate through the screens of that solution, right? And we will come up with user experience related ideas that helps the navigation better as well. And that also helps in aiding further ease in terms of the product or the solution itself, right? So that is a second process. So irrespective of whether it is custom or product, the evaluation criteria that we have is exactly what you mentioned, right? In terms of scalability, reliability, security, and also ease of use, Mr. Mohammed. So then why did I provide two different approaches? One is when it is a custom solution, you don't pay heavily for the licenses of the product, right? You pay for the build of the product, you pay for building all the new features. It might be a one-time investment and you don't have any restriction on the number of users that you want to add to the solution, right? But when you bring in a market product, the market product will come with its own prerogatives. It would say, you know, $5 per month per user. Then if you don't know, if tomorrow let's say you proliferate your user base from let's say 10 users to 100 users, then you might have to end up five into 100 times, right? So that was the reason why I gave two different approaches. So as part of next step discussions, we can also offer you the pros and cons of what kind of custom build, what does a custom solution mean? What does the product-driven solution mean? What kind of products are we looking at so that you can evaluate and come to a guided decision, Mr. Mohamed? Would that be okay? Okay, a bit better to give me this comparison. It will be very effective to take a decision. And the second issue you should consider, I will not host anything at my server, okay? We will not host ticketing system in our server, okay? Because we need to hosting outside factory, which having a multi-host and multi-redundancy system, okay? We need to hosting outside because our server here not stable, okay? And related to power supply and many issues. And having should have support from IT department to maintenance this server. No, we couldn't bear unstable system with this client. This client is important to having a good view about our product and our support, okay? Sure, so one another question, and thanks for that insight. One another question is, are you open to hosting the solution on the cloud? Okay, no problem. Give me the hosting solution. What you see it is more redundant and the more stable, okay? Give me solution for it. We are open for anything, okay? Okay, got it, fine. This first issue, second issue, give me this comparison. And including at this comparison, I need the timeline to be the system life. What meaning? Now, if we going into custom or ready-made ticketing system, how time I need to having this system working and in service for each one? Four months, two months, one month, one week. I want to know the timeframe to finalizing this project. Sure, sure. I think to arrive at that, Mr. Mohamed, there are, I will probably have two requests, right? Like maybe I cannot explain all of that now. I can probably send an email on what is the requirement. Minimally, what we need to understand is currently how are tickets being managed? Even if there is no ticket, how is it being managed? Right, I'd like to understand. No ticket. Only management by emails or Excel sheet. No ticketing is required. Fantastic. So I'd like to have a small session on how issues are solved through email. How long does it typically take for those issues to happen, right? Issues to get solved. At least to get a very high idea. It is solved by all the way. We receive an email from the client, okay? And the business is email. And we receive an email from the client. And we receive an email from the client.

            "Transcript :  We have IT team but we don't want him to involve it at this process to meet. Okay, fine. Because we need hosting outside and everything. Right. Regarding the IT requirement, we'll take off with the local act. We are being the local partner. We'll take off the IT requirement, whatever this locally required. Sure, Siraj. My question was not just on the hosting side. My question was, let's say, if tomorrow a new custom feature needs to be developed. Let's say Mr. Mohammad wants to add this feature. Will your team be able to add that feature to the application? No, no. Completely. We will take care of it, Mr. Anand. In this case, with the help of you, we'll take care of it. Okay, got it. Fine. Sure. Okay. Got it. Fine. So, I'll probably list down a list of questions. So, Arun, do you have any thoughts on this? Yes. Second, on the document management. So, that is also to be combined. So, from a document management perspective, what are you looking at? Are you looking at sharing between the organization? You have to understand what a document control management is. Okay? Now, we are a factory. We are having a test result. Okay? For all products. Should be hosting online for retrieving. We should have now, okay, all manuals. We should have all certificates. We should have all calibration certificates for test kits and equipment. We should have a document control which controls all types of documents with a good classification for it and a good searching tool. Okay? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So, are you using any enterprise system, ERP kind of system for your manufacturing process? We are having ERP system. Yes. But, as I told you from the first point, we need to be separate completely from the IT system and cloud system of our factory. We now have a new branch of the factory which should be independent of all the systems. Yeah. The ERP system, they don't want to touch any of the ERP system which they are using now with Microsoft Dynamics 365. But, they don't want to touch any of the system and let it be independent. That's what they plan. No, no. The reason why I'm asking is if there are documents coming from your ERP which has to be integrated, then it becomes like a single console. And, the ticketing also. It has to be an integrated system. Then, you have to see the integration points. That is why I'm asking whether you are using any ERP and how currently being done. Okay? Okay. I understood the question. Given that we just got the information that they are using Microsoft Dynamics 365, SharePoint is a very native document management system because SharePoint is Microsoft driven and there is already integrations with SharePoint and Microsoft 365. Right? So, that was another reason why we wanted to understand, Siraj, if SharePoint system is already being used or not. Yeah. So, you are on Dynamics 365 or you are into CRM earlier versions? What kind of version currently? Any idea, Siraj? We are what? On the Dynamics, you are into Dynamics 365 version. Which version of Dynamics Microsoft CRM you are into? Any idea? We are using 365. Okay. Got you. Okay. Any questions around document management system, Anand? Or we will put forth our questions to them. Yeah. I think it will be better to put forth our questions because I do have some thought process that when Dynamics 365 is being used, I do feel that there is probably an opportunity where Microsoft 365 is also being used as an enterprise solution. Which means SharePoint itself can be extended as a document management platform. We obviously need to understand and strategize how to manage the documents within SharePoint. Our current situation, this SharePoint and Team Planner and all other, it is required a special license from IT department here. Okay. And IT department not provide us for all this additional future for 365. Okay. So, only we use it as a normal and ordinary office. Okay. For our department. Now, we need to extend our work to including SharePoint and Microsoft Team Planner and everything which support our department and the factory at next stage. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay.\n",

            "Results: [\"but if we are taking the route, we will be providing all the necessary thought process and thought leadership around what are the technology stack that will allow you to scale in terms of volume. Secondly, the ease of use. So the ease of use predominantly happens depending on how the users are able to very quickly navigate through the screens of that solution, right? And we will come up with user experience related ideas that helps the navigation better as well. And that also helps in aiding further ease in terms of the product or the solution itself, right? So that is a second process. So irrespective of whether it is custom or product, the evaluation criteria that we have is exactly what you mentioned, right? In terms of scalability, reliability, security, and also ease of use, Mr. Mohammed. So then why did I provide two different approaches? One is when it is a custom solution, you don't pay heavily for the licenses of the product, right? You pay for the build of the product, you pay for building all the new features. It might be a one-time investment and you don't have any restriction on the number of users that you want to add to the solution, right? But when you bring in a market product, the market product will come with its own prerogatives. It would say, you know, $5 per month per user. Then if you don't know, if tomorrow let's say you proliferate your user base from let's say 10 users to 100 users, then you might have to end up five into 100 times, right? So that was the reason why I gave two different approaches. So as part of next step discussions, we can also offer you the pros and cons of what kind of custom build, what does a custom solution mean? What does the product-driven solution mean? What kind of products are we looking at so that you can evaluate and come to a guided decision, Mr. Mohamed? Would that be okay? Okay, a bit better to give me this comparison. It will be very effective to take a decision. And the second issue you should consider, I will not host anything at my server, okay? We will not host ticketing system in our server, okay? Because we need to hosting outside factory, which having a multi-host and multi-redundancy system, okay? We need to hosting outside because our server here not stable, okay? And related to power supply and many issues. And having should have support from IT department to maintenance this server. No, we couldn't bear unstable system with this client. This client is important to having a good view about our product and our support, okay? Sure, so one another question, and thanks for that insight. One another question is, are you open to hosting the solution on the cloud? Okay, no problem. Give me the hosting solution. What you see it is more redundant and the more stable, okay? Give me solution for it. We are open for anything, okay? Okay, got it, fine. This first issue, second issue, give me this comparison. And including at this comparison, I need the timeline to be the system life. What meaning? Now, if we going into custom or ready-made ticketing system, how time I need to having this system working and in service for each one? Four months, two months, one month, one week. I want to know the timeframe to finalizing this project. Sure, sure. I think to arrive at that, Mr. Mohamed, there are, I will probably have two requests, right? Like maybe I cannot explain all of that now. I can probably send an email on what is the requirement. Minimally, what we need to understand is currently how are tickets being managed? Even if there is no ticket, how is it being managed? Right, I'd like to understand. No ticket. Only management by emails or Excel sheet. No ticketing is required. Fantastic. So I'd like to have a small session on how issues are solved through email. How long does it typically take for those issues to happen, right? Issues to get solved. At least to get a very high idea.

And we receive an email from the client.\", \"we forward to concern department and the concern department going to assign this work to his team and going team to solve after that sending email about confirmation about this ticket is this issue solve it all very all the way and we have what is the average system for this issue and as example if we solve this issue today after two year or three year no one remember he's solving this issue got it got it typically what is your average turnaround time for solving an issue i know it differs from issue to issue but what is the average turnaround time approximately is it one day two days how how much does it typically take we now going to do a new stage of our product what meaning the ticketing number will be different between correct clarification which require some only reply from us regarding the client and sometimes request a certificate and sometimes require one person from our team going to to test or sometimes need to replace i mean so there is no time frame for solving a ticket okay no clear time okay so so i am so sorry i am so sorry for many disturbance okay so the ticketing number time frame okay not clear with us now because we haven't clear issue about the future ticketing which will be raised but in future we should having a facility to a classifying a time frame okay for each type of ticketing we could when receiving a ticket we could say by concerning factory this need as example clarification or document submitting class we voting for a time day for one or two day like this repairing need one week so in future we could assign okay the concern to making a time frame to solving a ticketing now sure sure that makes sense that makes sense i i think um um you know i do have a few more questions but uh what i think will also help and the answers that you have provided mr muhammad is very very useful thank you for that so i will collate that but what i i also request is um given the given the discussion today i thought i will i will probably summarize the thought process i will also give a high level overview of what solutions can be offered and also add a few more questions that uh you know that can that i wanted to ask as well so that you know our next discussion becomes much more productive and you know we can probably get more in understanding about the overall thought process as well because i think you laid out very critical points so far about the requirement one is being able to scale to larger customer base to be hosted either to be hosted on the cloud or on the customer's premises but not hosted on kfb's premise right third is ease of use right and fourth is uh you are you are okay for having this entirely hosted on the cloud so which means that you don't have to worry about your server capability it's the cloud that will take care of all the server requirements right so that is something um yeah so some of my questions are going to be around your cloud usage and currently if there is any team that is using your cloud and whatnot so i'll add those questions as well um second thing is um uh you know in our next call i can probably do a comparison between the two options right like what does a custom option take and what does probably a product option take and um i'm pretty sure so far uh with whatever i have listened uh i think we we we have a solution like service now that can very well serve your needs right uh but we just want to be sure that um you know we we also give you the other option so that it becomes easier for you um another uh another request do you have an it team uh currently in-house\", \"We have IT team but we don't want him to involve it at this process to meet.

You got my point? Apologies, Mohamed, I got lost in between. Yeah, yeah, we heard it. Now, as example, I assign one engineer for testing RMU, okay, and I told him, okay, I need to finalizing this testing, okay, so I should assign to him this task, okay, automatically, okay, and after that, when he finish, raise his test result, as example, I approve about he finish this task, so after that, all tasks and all work is recording with the name of the engineer and the duration used, and when he start, when he finish, if he delay, if there is any clarification regarding the delay, like this, if this task is holded, okay, or postponed for one year or one week, whatever, okay, we need to tracking our team work. We want to tracking our team performance. It is something mandatory to understand the quality and production value for each person in our team. Okay, okay, not at the moment.

Okay, this is what I mean by workforce management system. I reading something before, and I having some proposal from another company like Smartsheet. I don't know if you know about it or not. They send to me some demo for Smartsheet. It is handle workforce management and something like this, but I don't going to in details with them. So, I explained to you the idea, and you study it and check what is a suitable solution. Yeah, see Microsoft Teams planner can be a good start, but I don't think it can be called as a workforce management tool, because when it comes to workforce management tool, it's a lot more new aspects will come in, right? Like, you know, who is assigned what task, how many hours are they spending effort. Teams planner might not be the best suitable tool for that. So, Smartsheet is yet another, you know, option, but Smartsheet again has its own limitations, right?

I'm assuming that you also would like people to move away from storing documents in their local desktops to store everything in this common one-stop shop. Yes, correct. Okay. While the document is being uploaded, I'm assuming that coming in the manufacturing industry, there are different types of documents that you might upload. You might upload a PDF, you might upload an image, you might upload a circuit diagram, which is probably in the form of a JPEG. Okay. Fine.

We make at my old company website and the database for handling equipment, test the kit between consumers, department and the site, okay?

Even if it was very good and stable and IT who designed the software was perfect, but it is failed because it is difficult to use, not friendly interface, so it is failing.

I understood from Siraj that you are, you want your customers, you know, I understand that your company is into electrical relay manufacturing and you supply electrical relays to other companies, right? And if the end customer has some query or has some problem with the electrical relays which you have supplied, that they need to log on to a system, raise a ticket so that it comes to your back end, you know, people and they find the system, they get this alert on the, you know, they get the alert, they look into what is the issue and they contact the, either they contact the customer or they solve their queries or issues, is my understanding right? Yes, but I need full tracking system for ticketing. What meaning? Customer raise a ticket, okay, and tracing who responsible to handling this ticket, even after that tracing steps of the solution, not only I raise ticket today, after four days or five days, it solve it and the clause by ticketing number like this, by reply like this. No. I need all steps that will be used for a sole solution and was mentioned all authorization and all people concerned at this issue, okay, with full record of the document for this solution. Because in future, when we dealing with national grid electricity company, as example, we have one project and submit our equipment, they raise some comment, okay, this comment coming to us and we reply by some document, maybe clause, after maybe four or five years, same comment maybe raise at another project, okay? Understood. At this case, I should having a very good tracking system to retrieve this document, which I replied before, with the full reply, with the full situation and concerning people from me and from client who approve about this reply and give a clearance to, as an evidence for a next project or future project. You got my point? Okay. Understood. Yeah. So that is pretty much the ticketing system is used for, right? It is not only for tracking the current issues, but also to revisit on the cases, which was there before, let's say one year or six months before, what is the issue, right? So that is how we give our, you give the customer experience or customer satisfaction to your vendors or to your clients. We totally get that. I'm just waiting for one other gentleman to join. So till the time he joins, right, let me understand more about the Dock 1 management system as well. Right. And, okay. Sorry. One minute. Sorry to interrupt you. So before you go to the Dock 1 management, Mr. Mohamed, could you please let me know the volume of tickets and the queries you're expecting on average? Your voice is not clear, please. Is it better now? Better now? No, not better. If you could write your question as a shirt, write it and I reply, no problem. No. Okay. His question was, Mohamed, so he was checking with you. What is the volume of, you know, tickets, you know, how many tickets per month or how many tickets per week will, you know, are you talking about, you know, currently? I get the point. Sorry, to be honest with you, now we are a factory for two or three products, okay. But we expected at the end of this year, we're having another four products, okay, and a huge product with a huge system. But we couldn't predict how many will be expected, a ticketing number per month, because we are a manufacturer and this is based on quality of your product and how much your client is aggressive and like this, many, many issues will control this issue. But for this time being, it is not more than, what we say, 20 tickets per week, per week, okay. Like this. Okay. Mohamed, maybe increase in the future. Yeah. Yeah. I have Anand, you know, who...\", \"the chief solutions officer for with Kennedy Software and I was expecting him to join here. So Anand, just to give you a background right, Mohamad is from KFP Group Holdings who are basically into electrical relay manufacturing and as we discussed you know he was pointing out to a ticketing system, the requirement right, the ticketing system, the document management system and on the workflow, the complete workflow management system for their organization right. So we, he started off discussing, we started off discussing on the ticketing system and just to give you a heads up you know this is for the clients, for their clients, you know when there is some issue or when there are some queries regarding their, the product right, they raise a ticket, it goes to their back-end team and they resolve it and you know they, he also wanted to track the previous tickets as well right, just to give a customer satisfaction right. So this is what has happened at the back-end and we were also checking with this, checking with them on how many tickets he is expecting per month or per week and he indicated 10 to 20 number tickets is what he has indicated. So that's the conversation and you can, I guess you can take it over from here Anand. Sure Srini, Mr. Mohamad sorry about joining a little late, I had some issues with my laptop. So from a ticketing standpoint right, Arun did we already touch base on ServiceNow as a ticketing platform? I didn't jump on ServiceNow but I was asking questions about the volume of tickets, what is the purpose of a ticket, how many people will be agents, I mean we are looking at to handle, I mean I didn't jump into solution but just waiting to understand more about that but feel free to go ahead. Sure, I mean I had just some follow-up questions right, so if it is 20 tickets per user per day or is it 20 tickets across all your users Mr. Mohamad? No, no 20 tickets per week, not per day, I'm not expecting too much ticket here because as I mentioned earlier it is dependent on your quality of product okay, we are not a service company, we are a manufacturer company. So based on quality of product you get the ticket but most of time it is not be more than 20 tickets per week. Regarding the organization, who will be using this ticket number okay, we could now estimate it about 10 up to 15 person in meantime but in future maybe increase because it's based on your business grow up and many factor effect is issue but let us start by 15 pairs. Okay, got it and I just want to mention here actually the company is mostly in the B2B business, it's not a B2C, so their customers are almost mostly will be like other manufacturers, other like you know it's all the electricity like big groups it's a B2B, so just consider this one when you come when you're I mean designing the solutions, it's how they don't be the end user. No, no I couldn't hear you. Yeah, no Mr. Mohamad, I'm saying I mean mostly of the customers. The second request which Mohamad want to talk about was on the document management Anand, we didn't start, we just then is workflow, the fourth one is cyber security but the priority he says to start with you know he's looking for ticketing solution, so when I'm understanding all the problems in the document management system that is the higher priority, first is ticketing management system, then document management system. Siraj, you were also mentioning about the workflow right to automate their workflow internal. Yes, yes the workflow is the one I mean therefore as a DMS document management system, it has to be integrated with the workflow. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for this. It's all right. No problem. Okay, your question again. No Mr. Mohamad, I was just trying to say to Mr. Anand that your customers are mostly like a business to the business customers right, we are not I mean so it will be like enterprise customer, so it won't be like end users correct, just to correct me if I'm wrong. No, no I couldn't get you ready. No, no what he means by that, so for example he's talking about your primary customers will be other companies, for example National Grid or other companies. It's not the end users, it's a company. Correct, that's what he's saying. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead Anand. Okay, and one another question that, so there are two or three different approaches for this Mr. Mohamad. One is we can, we can use a market friendly tool or a product.\", \"that is specifically built for ticketing related use cases right? Like service now we are a partner to service now and service now is one such product that has predominantly been used across the industries. For ticketing, ticket management, all kind of ticketing solutions. The other approach could be, but when we're talking about service now like products, what's going to happen is it has to scale up to your entire enterprise number one and it should also be scaling up to your customers enterprise as well, right? Like it's not just for. You, but also for your customers as well, right? So that is another aspect that we have to look at. The second approach could be that you know we can look at your specific needs because the volume of tickets that you're talking about is less. We could probably build a simple solution to start with that allows you to start managing the current volume of tickets right which could also be and slowly build it on top of economies of scale right like basically saying we can create a custom built product for you to handle your tickets and then start looking at what are the features that you want to add because when it is custom built it allows you to. Probably build more features as well rather than going and buying a product from the market, right? So that is another thought process that we had, but in in on the same wean I just had one question. Misha Mohammed. So when you are when you are designing will this ticketing platform be directly used by your customers or will your team be using this on behalf of your customers? OK, first regarding your question, my ticketing will support two issues for my for my factory. First issue is customer raising the problem which highlighting in the final product and second issue is the final product and at the same time it should be used by quality department regarding raising any defective or some issue he facing during checking the product before delivering to the end client. So it will be with my by my team and my end client. It will be support both issue. And second issue which I asking you now, you told me we having custom solution or we having a product approach or ready made solution. This based on how many tickets expected per week or per day. Regarding custom solution. In case on future OK this ticket increase. This custom solution could handle it or not. I don't know what is the future for me. Now we having talking about ticketing inside factory and outside factory and we talking about approximately maybe 10 product OK. So this 10 product in future maybe maybe we reaching to 200 ticketing per week as example 300. I don't know what is the future. So how much your customer solution will support me in the future? This first issue. Second issue, how much it is easy for use? OK, we don't need any complicated system. OK, we need to support a small application which could be using by all our employee or client to raise a ticket by easy way. OK. So could you answer me to this issue? Sure, thanks for bringing both these points. So when I when I mentioned a custom solution. What I what I did what I was actually alluding to was. Depending on your current needs and your future needs like today, you're saying there might be 20 tickets per day or 20 tickets maximum. Tomorrow it should scale to 200 tickets also, right? So any solution that we are trying to build, whether custom or from the market. That solution has to be scalable, reliable and it should also be appealing to the economies of scale. It should also be economical, right? So from a custom solution standpoint, custom solution I was talking more about building a web application for you right or building an application for you hosting it in your premises in your server and exposing that web application as a URL to your customers so that they can log into this particular product or solution and then be able to do whatever they want to do. Right? So ideally any solution that we build has to be strategically built in such a way that it can manage higher volume of tickets Mr Mohammed. So as part of the exercise, if we are taking the route of a custom solution and it's too early to do that now.\", \"but if we are taking the route, we will be providing all the necessary thought process and thought leadership around what are the technology stack that will allow you to scale in terms of volume. Secondly, the ease of use. So the ease of use predominantly happens depending on how the users are able to very quickly navigate through the screens of that solution, right? And we will come up with user experience related ideas that helps the navigation better as well. And that also helps in aiding further ease in terms of the product or the solution itself, right? So that is a second process. So irrespective of whether it is custom or product, the evaluation criteria that we have is exactly what you mentioned, right? In terms of scalability, reliability, security, and also ease of use, Mr. Mohammed. So then why did I provide two different approaches? One is when it is a custom solution, you don't pay heavily for the licenses of the product, right? You pay for the build of the product, you pay for building all the new features. It might be a one-time investment and you don't have any restriction on the number of users that you want to add to the solution, right? But when you bring in a market product, the market product will come with its own prerogatives. It would say, you know, $5 per month per user. Then if you don't know, if tomorrow let's say you proliferate your user base from let's say 10 users to 100 users, then you might have to end up five into 100 times, right? So that was the reason why I gave two different approaches. So as part of next step discussions, we can also offer you the pros and cons of what kind of custom build, what does a custom solution mean? What does the product-driven solution mean? What kind of products are we looking at so that you can evaluate and come to a guided decision, Mr. Mohamed? Would that be okay? Okay, a bit better to give me this comparison. It will be very effective to take a decision. And the second issue you should consider, I will not host anything at my server, okay? We will not host ticketing system in our server, okay? Because we need to hosting outside factory, which having a multi-host and multi-redundancy system, okay? We need to hosting outside because our server here not stable, okay? And related to power supply and many issues. And having should have support from IT department to maintenance this server. No, we couldn't bear unstable system with this client. This client is important to having a good view about our product and our support, okay? Sure, so one another question, and thanks for that insight. One another question is, are you open to hosting the solution on the cloud? Okay, no problem. Give me the hosting solution. What you see it is more redundant and the more stable, okay? Give me solution for it. We are open for anything, okay? Okay, got it, fine. This first issue, second issue, give me this comparison. And including at this comparison, I need the timeline to be the system life. What meaning? Now, if we going into custom or ready-made ticketing system, how time I need to having this system working and in service for each one? Four months, two months, one month, one week. I want to know the timeframe to finalizing this project. Sure, sure. I think to arrive at that, Mr. Mohamed, there are, I will probably have two requests, right? Like maybe I cannot explain all of that now. I can probably send an email on what is the requirement. Minimally, what we need to understand is currently how are tickets being managed? Even if there is no ticket, how is it being managed? Right, I'd like to understand. No ticket. Only management by emails or Excel sheet. No ticketing is required. Fantastic. So I'd like to have a small session on how issues are solved through email. How long does it typically take for those issues to happen, right? Issues to get solved. At least to get a very high idea. It is solved by all the way. We receive an email from the client, okay? And the business is email. And we receive an email from the client. And we receive an email from the client. And we receive an email from the client.\", \"we forward to concern department and the concern department going to assign this work to his team and going team to solve after that sending email about confirmation about this ticket is this issue solve it all very all the way and we have what is the average system for this issue and as example if we solve this issue today after two year or three year no one remember he's solving this issue got it got it typically what is your average turnaround time for solving an issue i know it differs from issue to issue but what is the average turnaround time approximately is it one day two days how how much does it typically take we now going to do a new stage of our product what meaning the ticketing number will be different between correct clarification which require some only reply from us regarding the client and sometimes request a certificate and sometimes require one person from our team going to to test or sometimes need to replace i mean so there is no time frame for solving a ticket okay no clear time okay so so i am so sorry i am so sorry for many disturbance okay so the ticketing number time frame okay not clear with us now because we haven't clear issue about the future ticketing which will be raised but in future we should having a facility to a classifying a time frame okay for each type of ticketing we could when receiving a ticket we could say by concerning factory this need as example clarification or document submitting class we voting for a time day for one or two day like this repairing need one week so in future we could assign okay the concern to making a time frame to solving a ticketing now sure sure that makes sense that makes sense i i think um um you know i do have a few more questions but uh what i think will also help and the answers that you have provided mr muhammad is very very useful thank you for that so i will collate that but what i i also request is um given the given the discussion today i thought i will i will probably summarize the thought process i will also give a high level overview of what solutions can be offered and also add a few more questions that uh you know that can that i wanted to ask as well so that you know our next discussion becomes much more productive and you know we can probably get more in understanding about the overall thought process as well because i think you laid out very critical points so far about the requirement one is being able to scale to larger customer base to be hosted either to be hosted on the cloud or on the customer's premises but not hosted on kfb's premise right third is ease of use right and fourth is uh you are you are okay for having this entirely hosted on the cloud so which means that you don't have to worry about your server capability it's the cloud that will take care of all the server requirements right so that is something um yeah so some of my questions are going to be around your cloud usage and currently if there is any team that is using your cloud and whatnot so i'll add those questions as well um second thing is um uh you know in our next call i can probably do a comparison between the two options right like what does a custom option take and what does probably a product option take and um i'm pretty sure so far uh with whatever i have listened uh i think we we we have a solution like service now that can very well serve your needs right uh but we just want to be sure that um you know we we also give you the other option so that it becomes easier for you um another uh another request do you have an it team uh currently in-house\", \"We have IT team but we don't want him to involve it at this process to meet. Okay, fine. Because we need hosting outside and everything. Right. Regarding the IT requirement, we'll take off with the local act. We are being the local partner. We'll take off the IT requirement, whatever this locally required. Sure, Siraj. My question was not just on the hosting side. My question was, let's say, if tomorrow a new custom feature needs to be developed. Let's say Mr. Mohammad wants to add this feature. Will your team be able to add that feature to the application? No, no. Completely. We will take care of it, Mr. Anand. In this case, with the help of you, we'll take care of it. Okay, got it. Fine. Sure. Okay. Got it. Fine. So, I'll probably list down a list of questions. So, Arun, do you have any thoughts on this? Yes. Second, on the document management. So, that is also to be combined. So, from a document management perspective, what are you looking at? Are you looking at sharing between the organization? You have to understand what a document control management is. Okay? Now, we are a factory. We are having a test result. Okay? For all products. Should be hosting online for retrieving. We should have now, okay, all manuals. We should have all certificates. We should have all calibration certificates for test kits and equipment. We should have a document control which controls all types of documents with a good classification for it and a good searching tool. Okay? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So, are you using any enterprise system, ERP kind of system for your manufacturing process? We are having ERP system. Yes. But, as I told you from the first point, we need to be separate completely from the IT system and cloud system of our factory. We now have a new branch of the factory which should be independent of all the systems. Yeah. The ERP system, they don't want to touch any of the ERP system which they are using now with Microsoft Dynamics 365. But, they don't want to touch any of the system and let it be independent. That's what they plan. No, no. The reason why I'm asking is if there are documents coming from your ERP which has to be integrated, then it becomes like a single console. And, the ticketing also. It has to be an integrated system. Then, you have to see the integration points. That is why I'm asking whether you are using any ERP and how currently being done. Okay? Okay. I understood the question. Given that we just got the information that they are using Microsoft Dynamics 365, SharePoint is a very native document management system because SharePoint is Microsoft driven and there is already integrations with SharePoint and Microsoft 365. Right? So, that was another reason why we wanted to understand, Siraj, if SharePoint system is already being used or not. Yeah. So, you are on Dynamics 365 or you are into CRM earlier versions? What kind of version currently? Any idea, Siraj? We are what? On the Dynamics, you are into Dynamics 365 version. Which version of Dynamics Microsoft CRM you are into? Any idea? We are using 365. Okay. Got you. Okay. Any questions around document management system, Anand? Or we will put forth our questions to them. Yeah. I think it will be better to put forth our questions because I do have some thought process that when Dynamics 365 is being used, I do feel that there is probably an opportunity where Microsoft 365 is also being used as an enterprise solution. Which means SharePoint itself can be extended as a document management platform. We obviously need to understand and strategize how to manage the documents within SharePoint. Our current situation, this SharePoint and Team Planner and all other, it is required a special license from IT department here. Okay. And IT department not provide us for all this additional future for 365. Okay. So, only we use it as a normal and ordinary office. Okay. For our department. Now, we need to extend our work to including SharePoint and Microsoft Team Planner and everything which support our department and the factory at next stage. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. Okay.\", \"Any other question for document control? So another question that I have, and maybe I'll list down the list of questions, but at a high level, when you talk about document control, I'm assuming that you're also looking at a workflow where the documents will be approved by multiple approvers. Is that a fair understanding? You are correct. You are correct. Okay. Because not all people have the authority to raise this document and without approval, without anything, no. Okay. I'm assuming that you also would like people to move away from storing documents in their local desktops to store everything in this common one-stop shop. Yes, correct. Okay. While the document is being uploaded, I'm assuming that coming in the manufacturing industry, there are different types of documents that you might upload. You might upload a PDF, you might upload an image, you might upload a circuit diagram, which is probably in the form of a JPEG. Okay. Fine. So all these questions, I'll probably put in my questionnaire as well, Mr. Mohammad, might need some help. If you summarize this question, we will have a good meeting and the highlight for this NIC system. Sure, we'll do. Okay, fine. Mohammad, you were also mentioning about this. Just one question. Yeah. What is the total employee size, Mohammad? Your employee organization size? What total employee size? Yeah. Yes. I couldn't predict, really. I couldn't predict. Look, now to explain for all of you, what is now, what our future now. Now, we have a small factory, for medium voltage, and a new product as explained area, okay? If this experience succeed with IT, regarding document control, ticketing system, it will be extended to a whole factory, and after that extended to a whole group. So, I couldn't give you the prediction or expected volume size for document control, volume size for ticketing number, because maybe in future, no, this extended too much, even when we including the group, okay? So, this based on the quality of the product and how easy to use. As example, I will explain to you one experience I facing before. We make at my old company website and the database for handling equipment, test the kit between consumers, department and the site, okay? Unfortunately, because the system is more complicated and you need too much authority, it is failed, okay? Even if it was very good and stable and IT who designed the software was perfect, but it is failed because it is difficult to use, not friendly interface, so it is failing. So, I couldn't predict in future this system fail or succeed. If it succeed, sure, sure, it's volume will be a huge because it is including our factory and maybe including another factory. Okay, thanks, Mohamed. Pleasure, yeah, thank you. And Mohamed, you were also mentioning about the cybersecurity, right? Is it kind of an immediate requirement you're talking? Cybersecurity, it should be from automation department and unfortunately, they not attend the meeting because they having some urgent work. So, let me, support me by sending all your questions regarding cybersecurity at your email so I could discuss with them and arrange another meeting. Sure, okay, got it. So, we have more details about the cybersecurity. I will share more details, I have some details. Once the meeting is finished, with the help of, I'll discuss with Mr. Mohamed also and get more information, share the details for the cybersecurity, okay? Okay, thank you. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Mohamed. Last issue is the workforce management system, okay? I don't know if Microsoft team Bilan-Arkad could support this issue or no. Okay, so workforce management and any specific use case you're looking at? Look, what we need? We need in future, control the tasks which will be assigned to our team. And as an example, if I have 50 or 10.\", \"sorry, if I have 50 or 100 engineers at the factory, okay, I should know who do what and when, and when expected to finish, and if he delayed, I could cumulate this delay to understand what is the problem. You got my point? Apologies, Mohamed, I got lost in between. Yeah, yeah, we heard it. Now, as example, I assign one engineer for testing RMU, okay, and I told him, okay, I need to finalizing this testing, okay, so I should assign to him this task, okay, automatically, okay, and after that, when he finish, raise his test result, as example, I approve about he finish this task, so after that, all tasks and all work is recording with the name of the engineer and the duration used, and when he start, when he finish, if he delay, if there is any clarification regarding the delay, like this, if this task is holded, okay, or postponed for one year or one week, whatever, okay, we need to tracking our team work. We want to tracking our team performance. It is something mandatory to understand the quality and production value for each person in our team. Okay, okay, not at the moment. So, I don't know if Microsoft team planner could support me at this issue or not. Okay, I doubt it can, based on my understanding, but we'll come back to you on that, Mr. Mohamed. Okay, this is what I mean by workforce management system. I reading something before, and I having some proposal from another company like Smartsheet. I don't know if you know about it or not. They send to me some demo for Smartsheet. It is handle workforce management and something like this, but I don't going to in details with them. So, I explained to you the idea, and you study it and check what is a suitable solution. Yeah, see Microsoft Teams planner can be a good start, but I don't think it can be called as a workforce management tool, because when it comes to workforce management tool, it's a lot more new aspects will come in, right? Like, you know, who is assigned what task, how many hours are they spending effort. Teams planner might not be the best suitable tool for that. So, Smartsheet is yet another, you know, option, but Smartsheet again has its own limitations, right? So, we will definitely get back to you on that, and maybe as part of our questions, we'll also request you to explain the other use cases as well, so that we'll do some kind of research and come back to you. Okay, awesome. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Thank you, Mohammad. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for your time, and we shall come back to you with the questionnaires. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you so much. Thanks for arranging this. Thanks, Mr. Mohammad, and thank you. Yeah, good to connect, yeah. Thank you. Thank you, bye.\"]\n",
